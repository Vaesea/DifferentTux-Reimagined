# DifferentTux Reimagined
Tux wakes up in a different world, and he feels like a DifferentTux! He actually doesn't feel like a different Tux, sorry.

Anyways, this unofficial add-on is inspired by both Tux Junior and Forest World Adventure Pack.

This is a reimagined version of my cancelled SuperTux 0.3.2 mod, DifferentTux.

This was a repository for a grassland add-on but I'm no longer working on that grassland add-on thing, at least for now.

## Things Needed
This is being moved to the wiki.

## What else is there
There was a story section for the grassland add-on but 1. the story is terrible and 2. the grassland add-on is no longer being worked on (for now, i might work on it later)
