# DifferentTux Reimagined
Tux wakes up in a different world, and he feels like a DifferentTux! He actually doesn't feel like a different Tux, sorry.

Anyways, this unofficial add-on is inspired by both Tux Junior and Forest World Adventure Pack.

This is a reimagined version of my cancelled SuperTux 0.3.2 mod, DifferentTux.

This was a repository for a grassland add-on but I'm no longer working on that grassland add-on thing, at least for now.

## Things Needed
This has been moved to the wiki.
